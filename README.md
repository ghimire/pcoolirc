pcoolirc
========

pCool CLI based Perl IRC Client is released under the terms and license of GNU General Public License (GPLv2)

I'd like to personally thank Robey Pointer (http://www.lag.net/say2/) for his excellent work in writing TextEntry.pm and TextScroll.pm perl modules.

### Usage:  
Modify the following variables in pcoolirc.pl file  before running it.  
  
    my $server = 'irc.server.org';  
    my $nick = 'nick';  
    my $login= 'real name';  
    my $channel = '#channel';  
    my $port = 6667;  
  
### Limitations:  
Only plain-text port is supported. If you want to add support to SSL ports such as 6697 feel free to fork :)
